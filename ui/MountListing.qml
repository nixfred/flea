// The five second "gio mount -li" poll, lifted out of ui/NetworkMounts.qml whole so that file has
// room in the 0.1.4 composition. The Service reads "text" when "listed" fires, and its own
// pollMounts() is the only thing outside this file that calls poll().
// -i rides along for ui/js/Phones.js: a phone volume's activation_root and can_mount print only
// under it, and both spellings measured half a second on this box over three interleaved runs, with
// no separation between the arms, because the cost is walking the volume monitors and not printing.
