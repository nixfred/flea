// The Locked tile's own menu, issue 193 follow-up (GM, 2026-09-24). A right click on the
// tile names the locked folder itself, never the parent behind it, so only rows that act
// on that folder without listing it are offered: terminal, permissions and path. Kept in
// ui/js/Menu.js INVENTORY order, one group, so the menu never reorders under its caller.
// Controller ruling for 0.3.8: the tile keeps its single Copy path row, acting as before,
// while its visibility follows the Copy as switch that replaced Copy path in Settings > Menus.
// A Places row's menu keeps the flat row the same way (ui/js/Menu.js availableEntry).
