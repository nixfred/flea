// The DEVICES group's phone rows, the third Service beside ui/DeviceMounts.qml (block devices over
// lsblk) and ui/NetworkMounts.qml (shares over gio). An Android phone or a camera is a gvfs volume
// with no block device behind it, so lsblk can never list one; only the volume monitors can, and
// ui/MountListing.qml's five second listing already walks them, so this Service reads that text
// through ui/NetworkMounts.qml rather than earning a second 500 ms gio walk of its own.
// It only lists and unmounts: mounting and opening ride ui/NetworkMounts.qml's openShare leg,
// because an mtp:// uri mounts, resolves its FUSE folder and opens exactly the way a share does.
