# This repo had twelve suites and no runner: seven were invoked by no file at all, including
# js.sh, the largest. A suite nobody runs reads as coverage in a directory listing and provides
# none. It happened again in 0.1.4: picker.sh, capability-ownership.sh and network-live.sh were
# named by no file at all, so the release's largest new surface had no automated coverage. The
# audit at the bottom is what makes that a failure here rather than a review finding later.
#
# Each suite's OWN exit code is read, never a pipeline's. `./tests/js.sh | tail -1` hands you
# tail's status and reports success over a red suite, which is how a wrong green survived here
# for a whole session.
