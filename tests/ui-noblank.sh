# ui/PaneSwap.qml counts, from the window's own afterAnimating, every frame handed to the scene graph
# while a listing was out and the pane was drawn in the loading state, and the case requires that
# count not to move across Enter, a double click and BackSpace in a 300-file folder, in all three
# views. The stub backend below answers two directories late: one inside the cap, which must be held
# for its whole wait, and one past it, which must fall back to the loading state and is the control
# that proves the counter sees frames at all, since the loading frames it counts are drawn empty too.
